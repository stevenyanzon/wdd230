      <h3>Alignment</h3>
      <h4>Crucial Company</h4>
      <h4>
        <a href="https://www.crucial.com/" target="_blank">crucial.com</a>
      </h4>
      <img src="images/crucial.jpg" alt="screenshot of crucial mobile website">
      <p>The crucial mobile website is a good example of where alignment is consistenly applied.
        Every product that is being offered is presented in the middle part of the website
        along with the header and footer. As well as the articles and awards received by the website.
      This made it easy to scroll through everything smoothly.</p>

      <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
      <h4>Nike Company</h4>
      <h4>
        <a href="https://www.nike.com/ph/" target="_blank">nike.com</a>
      </h4>
      <img src="images/nike.jpg" alt="screenshot of nike mobile website">
      <p>Everything can be easily found and will lessen the time to decide what to purchase
        when you can just filter out the options that you are looking for. The nike mobile website does a good job with the Hick's Law
        and will definitely help the user have a great experience browsing and shopping.</p>

      <h3>Repetition</h3>
      <h4>Mcdonald's Company</h3>
      <h4>
        <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com.ph/" target="_blank">mcdonalds.com</a>
      </h4>
      <img src="images/mcdo.jpg" alt="screenshot of mcdonalds mobile website">
      <p>All throughout the mobile website and in every picture of the foods and drinks that
        they are offering, the logo of Mcdonalds is always a part of it. This gives consistency
        to the design that is being followed which is repetition.
