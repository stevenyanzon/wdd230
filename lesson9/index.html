     <h2>Cool facts about bees</h2>
     <img src="images/bees.jpg" alt="bee on a flower">
     <h5><a href="https://saveourbees.com.au/11-unbelievable-facts-about-bees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saveourbees.com.au</a></h5>
      <p><b>1. A Honey bee colony has about 50,000 bees</b>
      <br>More than 99% are infertile female bees(worker bees). At most only few hundred male
      <br>bees (drones) and just one mother (the queen bee).</p>

      <p><b>2. A queen bee will only mate once in its lifetime</b>
      <br>This is usually in the first 10 days of its life when it will go on a mating
      <br>flight to mate with about 15 to 20 drones in mid-air. It will then store about
      <br>100 million sperm in its spermatheca for its entire life.</p>

      <p><b>3. A queen bee can lay twice it's body weight in eggs each day</b>
      <br>That's about 2500 eggs in a single day.</p>

      <p><b>4. Bees have 4 wings, 6 legs and 5 eyes</b>
      <br>This includes 3 simple eyes and 2 compound eyes made up of around
      <br>7,000 facets or lenses each.</p>

      <p><b>5. Bees see blue better than red</b>
      <br>This enables bees to see ultraviolet light and use this to help
      <br>navigate their way around and assist identifying flowers as they pollinate.
      <br>Yet bees cannot distinguish red colours well at all.</p>

      <p><b>6. A bee flaps its' wings up to 200 times per second</b>
      <br>This produces the familiar bee buzz. This rapid flapping produces a small
      <br>positive charge that attracts pollen to its furry body from flowers that are
      <br>negatively charged naturally.</p>

      <p><b>7. Worker bees communicate with a dance</b>
      <br>Whilst all bees produce and sense pheromones to communicate, only
      <br>the worker bees dance to communicate with other workers. This is known as
      <br>the waggle dance. She will rapidly shake her body from side to side in a
      <br>certain direction to tell worker bees which direction and how far food
      <br>sources can be found.</p>

      <p><b>8. Bees collect and produce more than just honey</b>
      <br>These include many things used by the bees and harvested by humans including
      <br>propolis, pollen, beeswax, royal jelly and bee venom.</p>

      <p><b>9. A honey bee will produce about 1/12 of a teaspoon
      <br>of honey in it's lifetime</b>
      <br>This depends on where the bees live and from which flowers bees are able to
      <br>forage. This means bees will collectively visit thousands of flowers to make
      <br>just one teaspoon full of honey.</p>

      <p><b>10. The drones only purpose in life is to mate with a queen bee</b>
      <br>It does not work or forage at all and can not sting.</p>
      
      <p><b>11. Drones do not have a father</b>
      <br>But have only a mother and a grandfather. The drone is created from and
      <br>unfertilised egg and inherits all its genetics from its mother and grandfather.
      <br>This is known as parthenogenesis.</p>
